<font size="+2"><strong>Introduction</strong></font><br>
Welcome! My name is Zou Chenxuanyin, and I am a graduate student in the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries at Northeastern University in Liaoning province and will obtain my Master's degree in 2023. I am looking for a Ph.D. position.

<br><br>
My research interests focus on multiobjective optimization, semi-infinite programming, and optimal control. I am devoted to handling multiobjective optimization problems with inequality path constraints in non-linear dynamic systems. Furthermore, I have a broad knowledge of multiobjective methods. I am currently trying to incorporate parallel and distributed computation into my research to intensify the power of algorithms to solve large-scale and complicated problems and improve efficiency. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://zcxy-academic.github.io/research" target="_self">research page</a> to learn more!
