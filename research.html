<strong><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9888236">Multiobjective Dynamic Optimization of Nonlinear Systems With Path Constraints</a></strong>, <br>IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 2022<br>Jun Fu; Chenxuanyin Zou; Mingsheng Zhang; Xinglong Lu; Yuzhe Li<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>In this article, two algorithms are proposed to solve multiobjective path-constrained dynamic optimization problems. In each algorithm, an adaptive ε -constraint method is employed to solve the multiobjective dynamic optimization problems (MODOPs) with path constraints in two iterative loops. In the outer loop, the adaptive ε -constraint method adaptively adjusts the choice of the parameters ε , which transfers MODOP into a sequence of single-objective dynamic optimization problems (SODOPs) with extra inequality constraints. In the inner loop, two different algorithms are used to solve the single-objective optimization problems. The first algorithm guarantees that the path constraints can be satisfied with any finite prescribed tolerance by replacing path constraints with a finite number of point constraints. Furthermore, the second algorithm guarantees that the path constraints are rigorously satisfied by enforcing the path constraints at a limited number of time points and by restricting the right-hand side of the path constraints. The proposed algorithms are proven to converge within finite iterations. The effectiveness of the algorithms is verified via numerical studies, along with a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm. </p>

<strong>An alternated direction method for consrained multiobjective optimization problems</strong><br>Jun Fu; Chenxuanyin Zou<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>We propose a novel SQP-type method for constrained multiobjective optimization problems in this paper. The proposed algorithm utilizes quadratic-constraint quadratic subproblems, where one alternated objective predominates while the others do not increase, for parallel Pareto improvement. This method divides one generation of solutions into non-dominated and dominated parts, where the former mainly searches the descent direction based on the subproblems, and the latter either descends based on the subproblems or follows the closest non-dominated point according to the score function. The convergence, of the proposed algorithm, to premium Pareto solutions, is discussed under the differential assumptions. Furthermore, a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm in the numerical results verifies the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</p><br>
