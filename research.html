<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>In this article, two algorithms are proposed to solve multiobjective path-constrained dynamic optimization problems. In each algorithm, an adaptive ε-constraint method is employed to solve the multiobjective dynamic optimization problems (MODOPs) with path constraints in two iterative loops. In the outer loop, the adaptive ε -constraint method adaptively adjusts the choice of the parameters ε , which transfers MODOP into a sequence of single-objective dynamic optimization problems (SODOPs) with extra inequality constraints. In the inner loop, two different algorithms are used to solve the single-objective optimization problems. The first algorithm guarantees that the path constraints can be satisfied with any finite prescribed tolerance by replacing path constraints with a finite number of point constraints. Furthermore, the second algorithm guarantees that the path constraints are rigorously satisfied by enforcing the path constraints at a limited number of time points and by restricting the right-hand side of the path constraints. The proposed algorithms are proven to converge within finite iterations. The effectiveness of the algorithms is verified via numerical studies, along with a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm. </p>

<strong>An alternated direction method for consrained multiobjective optimization problems</strong><br>
Jun Fu; Chenxuanyin Zou<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> We propose a new SQP-type method to solve the multiobjective optimization problem. A novel quadratically constrained quadratic subproblem is proposed for directional descent and is further extended to a new form to search on the Pareto Front. This algorithm includes two steps, where the first is the descent to the Pareto front and the second is searching on the Pareto front. The former subproblem leads the solution to the individual minimum of the objective and then alternate objective function to generate evenly distributed Pareto solutions. In addition, the former provides an upper bound of the descent value of one selected objective for that subproblem of Fliege, handling the drawbacks of a priori methods that the unpredictable locations of solutions might lead to the irregular random distribution of numerical Pareto solutions, i.e., an incomplete Pareto front. Moreover, the second step is the first approach that has ever been proposed to search on the Pareto front, which saves the repetitive process from initial points to the optimum and facilitates obtaining the information around received solutions.</p><br>
