## Introduction
Welcome! My name is Zou Chenxuanyin, and I am a Master's student (ranking first) in the Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries at Northeastern University in Liaoning Province with a Master's degree on July 5, 2023. I am going to be a Ph.D. student at the University of British Columbia on January 1, 2024.

My research interests focus on multiobjective optimization, semi-infinite programming, and optimal control. I am devoted to handling multiobjective optimization problems with inequality path constraints in non-linear dynamic systems. Furthermore, I have a broad knowledge of multiobjective methods. I am currently trying to incorporate parallel and distributed computation into my research to intensify the power of algorithms to solve large-scale and complicated problems and improve efficiency.
