I have just graduated from control theory and control engineering, at Northeastern University (NEU), Shenyang, China, and obtained the Master's degree on July 5, 2023. I started my academic career in control theory, with a Bachelor's degree in Automation from Northeastern University in 2016.

In my undergraduate, I was keen on mathematical modeling and have attended national contests many times. So, I have a solid foundation in numerical computation, which is conducive to my future research on optimization and optimal control in the Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, NEU.

Since I was enrolled in the experimental class of the fourth, the best one at NEU. I was influenced a lot by this group of strivers. I was going to find a job before. However, their enthusiasm for learning, strong cohesion, the slogan to be excellent, and predecessors' achievements stimulate me for higher pursuits. People always say that the final death is when the last memory about you fades. So I intend to make some unforgettably extraordinary achievements.

In 2020, I was recommended to be an Academic Master in the Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, NEU. I was devoted to the optimization methods and applied them to optimal control problems. In 2022, my comprehensive ranking was the first in the laboratory, and received the enterprise scholarship.

 Under the guidance of my supervisor Jun Fu, my research focuses on dynamic multiobjective optimization for optimal control problems of nonlinear systems with path constraints. Moreover, I am currently studying novel methods without a priori parameters for constrained multiobjective optimization problems and trying to integrate them with distributed algorithms. Moreover, there will be some applications for industrial processes.
